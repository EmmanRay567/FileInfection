This repository contains the core JUCE plugin source code.
Build files and project generators are intentionally excluded for portability.

# FileInfection
> Personal Project — independently designed and developed using C++ and the JUCE framework.
A JUCE-based audio plugin built in **C++**, focused on glitch-inspired sound processing and a custom, minimal user interface.

> **Note:** The plugin UI is branded as **VirusInfection.exe**, while **FileInfection** refers to the underlying project and codebase. The naming reflects the glitch/malware-inspired aesthetic of the plugin.

## Overview

FileInfection is an experimental audio plugin designed to explore real-time audio processing, parameter control, and custom UI behavior using the JUCE framework. The project combines technical DSP concepts with a creative, glitch-oriented visual and sonic style.

## Features

- Glitch-style audio processing effects
- Real-time parameter control
- Custom plugin UI
- Standalone and VST3 build targets
- Minimal, performance-focused design

---

## Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **JUCE Framework**
- Audio plugin development (VST3 / Standalone)

---

## What I Learned

- Structuring and building audio plugins with JUCE
- Managing real-time audio processing safely
- Connecting UI components to audio parameters
- Debugging DSP and UI interaction issues
- Designing simple, usable plugin interfaces

---

## Project Focus

This project was built as an independent exploration of creative audio tool development. The goal was to deepen my understanding of JUCE, real-time audio systems, and interactive plugin design while maintaining a strong visual and thematic identity.

## Future Improvements

- Expanded DSP and modulation options
- Additional glitch-style effects
- UI visual refinements
- Preset system support
